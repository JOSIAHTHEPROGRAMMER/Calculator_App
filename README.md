# Console Calculator
A simple C# console application that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.

## Features
- Addition (A)

- Multiplication (X)

- Subtraction (S)

- Division (D)

- Modulus (M)

- Case insensitive input for continuation (Y or YES to keep running)

## How It Works
- The program asks you which operation to perform.

- You enter the first number (x) and the second number (y).

- The program performs the chosen operation and displays the result.

- You are asked if you want to continue. Enter Y or YES (case-insensitive) to run again, otherwise the program ends.

Hello, Lets calculate!!

Types:
X = multiplication

S = subtraction
D = division
M = modulation

A

What is the value of x
10

What is the value of y

Do you wish to continue calculation stuff?? (Y / N )
